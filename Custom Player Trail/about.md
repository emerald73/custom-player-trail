# Custom Player Trail

## A mod that started because I personally wanted to have a rainbow trail, and then I decided to make it more customizeable

### And I also decided to make it public because like 2 people asked me to


# _Featuring:_

- Rainbow player trail with adjustable speed, saturation, etc.
- The ability to customize both player 1 and 2 trails separately
- Disable the trail outright if you feel like it idk why you'd download this mod if you did tho

That's about it I think, feel free to submit an issue on [the repo](https://github.com/emerald73/custom-player-trail) or contact me on Discord @gdemerald if you have any issues!
